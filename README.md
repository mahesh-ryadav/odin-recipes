# Odin Recipes


This is a basic HTML project from The Odin Project Foundations course.


## Project Description
A simple multi-page recipe website built using only HTML. The goal of this project is to practice:
- HTML boilerplate structure
- Headings, lists, images, and links
- Folder structure and relative paths
- Git and GitHub workflow


Styling will be added later using CSS.
